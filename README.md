# Online Banking System V1.2

Welcome to the Online Banking System GitHub repository! This project consists of two (`Java applications`) the Bank System and the Client App. Together, they form a comprehensive online banking system capable of performing various banking tasks securely and efficiently.

## Features

- **Bank System:** The Bank System serves as the backend infrastructure for managing user accounts, transactions, and other banking operations. It provides a secure environment for processing and storing sensitive financial data.

- **Client App:** The Client App is the front-end interface that allows users to interact with the online banking system. Users can perform tasks such as checking account balances, transferring funds, paying bills, and managing their accounts.

- **Online Transactions with OTP:** The system supports online transactions with an added layer of security through one-time passwords (OTPs). This ensures that transactions are authenticated and authorized by the account holder.

- **Comprehensive Banking Functions:** Users can perform all standard banking functions, including:

    - Account management (creation, deletion, updating)
    - Fund transfers between accounts (within the bank or to external accounts)
    - Bill payments (utilities, credit card bills, loans, etc.)
    - Transaction history and statements
    - Account balance inquiries
    - Reports Generator (All the Details)
    - And more.
- **Database Integration:** The Online Banking System integrates with a relational database management system (RDBMS) to store and retrieve user account information, transaction data, and other relevant details securely. Commonly used databases include (`MySQL`), (`PostgreSQL`), or (`HeidiSQL`).
